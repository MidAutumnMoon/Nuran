# Code cultivation: make the job clear and the structure tell the truth

Start with what the caller needs, not the techniques used to produce it. If every caller must run `download(source)` and then `verify(file, expected_hash)`, and an unverified tarball has no valid use, those steps are one operation. Expose `fetch_tarball(source, expected_hash)` and return either a verified tarball or an error. Private helpers may still handle network I/O and hashing; callers should not have to coordinate them.

Apply the same test to a module or service. For example, an updater may replace a pin only after all downloaded artifacts and generated records identify the same release. Organize the module around that job, rather than a row of equally prominent `fetch`, `parse`, and `render` stages.

Ask two questions throughout the review:

1. What job does this code finish?
2. What must the structure guarantee before that job is finished?

Naming the job is not enough. A tidy operation can still permit contradictory states, duplicate facts, hide dependencies, or mishandle failures and resource limits.

## Find the job

Before judging names or abstractions:

- Read the behavior, callers, tests, help, examples, schemas, and relevant documentation. Inspect history if the code looks half-migrated.
- Write one concrete sentence: "This code produces X. X is valid only when Y. This prevents Z."
- Record the valid states and ordinary transitions.
- Identify who should own state, policy, validation, cleanup, retries, and commit.
- Decide which intermediate values have legitimate uses of their own.
- Note the consumers, lifetime, compatibility requirements, trust boundaries, and resource limits.
- Follow the input through the decisions and data structures that produce the external effect.

For persisted or generated state, include creation, validation, consumption, update, recovery, and migration. Find every consumer before changing an exported symbol or stored shape. Blast radius is a query, not a guess.

Review the path that produces the result, not files in isolation. Treat the current structure as evidence, not authority. Assume surprising code may carry a constraint until behavior, callers, or history show otherwise.

When qualities conflict, prefer:

1. observable behavior and domain truth;
2. a complete operation backed by its data model and API;
3. explicit invariants, clear ownership, and one-way data flow;
4. one authoritative home for each fact and fewer degrees of freedom;
5. less mechanism and indirection;
6. precise expression over superficial uniformity.

Do not claim more than the evidence proves. A sample, metadata field, default, or heuristic cannot prove an exact claim. Check the probe and selector before changing code around their output.

## End each unit with a usable result

Treat the name of a function, type, or module as a contract. Ask:

- What may the caller safely do with the result?
- Has the unit done everything its name implies?
- Must every caller remember the same next call?
- Can an unsafe, contradictory, or useless intermediate escape?
- Does the boundary follow a useful result, or merely a switch from I/O to parsing, parsing to validation, or one library to another?

Keep steps together when one is useless without the other, a later step validates or commits an earlier one, they share cleanup or retry policy, or they change for the same reason.

Keep them separate when the intermediate result has its own consumer, lifecycle, policy, recovery role, or trust boundary. An editor, for example, may need an invalid syntax tree so it can report several errors. If every caller needs a valid configuration, parsing and validation usually belong behind one loading operation.

Different verbs do not require different boundaries. Sequential calls do not necessarily belong together. Put the boundary where the caller receives something it can use.

A complete operation need not be one large function. Use helpers to hide detail, but leave the decisions, order, and success condition visible in the main flow.

## Shape the structure around the job

Once the job is clear, inspect the structure:

- Represent valid states and transitions directly. Add a distinction when states differ in validity or ownership; remove one that exists only to be synchronized.
- Prevent invalid construction where practical instead of checking the same combination in every caller.
- Give each invariant and mutable fact one owner. Keep policy in data instead of copying it into labels, defaults, schemas, tests, and documentation.
- Pass required context forward. Do not discard information and reconstruct it later, or read ambient state that the caller already knows.
- Introduce a type when it prevents invalid use, carries durable identity, crosses a real boundary, or owns a lifecycle or policy. Do not name every pipeline stage with a type.
- Keep domain decisions easier to see than URL construction, adapters, serialization, and formatting.
- Generalize only when real uses share policy and ownership. Similar syntax may encode different knowledge.
- Make errors, cancellation, retries, locking, cleanup, and resource use match the operation's contract.

Look for these signs:

- names or comments that say "exact", "safe", or "identical" but rely on samples, defaults, or metadata;
- fields, flags, or collections that callers must keep synchronized, or that some modes ignore;
- ordinary changes that require edits to validators, defaults, schemas, and labels;
- callers that always pair the same operations or rebuild the same context;
- half-finished migrations, stale aliases, dead dependents, magic offsets, and cleanup that compensates for an earlier mistake.

Trace each symptom backward. Move the rule to the earliest boundary or representation that can enforce it instead of polishing downstream compensation.

Do not delete a useful seam because it looks thin. A filesystem wrapper that rebases paths and reports errors consistently owns shared path and error policy. A one-off helper is also fine when it stays local and duplicates no policy.

## Change the responsible boundary

Argue for the current shape before replacing it. An intermediate value may have a real consumer. A split may protect recovery, cancellation, locking, or a trust boundary. A small abstraction may own context that one call site does not show.

For each finding, state the evidence, consequence, and confidence. Do not assume that the largest function or oldest abstraction caused the problem.

For a risky change, run the smallest reversible probe that can confirm the suspected cause. Then repair the responsible boundary and make a clean cutover. Update callers, tests, schemas, persisted forms, and relevant documentation. Remove obsolete paths, aliases, parallel implementations, and compensations whose cause is gone.

Compatibility is a requirement to prove, not a default. When stored data changes, migrate it, reject old data explicitly, or preserve compatibility. For schemas, versions, and generated artifacts, choose and document the authoritative form. Make edits and upgrades deliberate. Keep tests, help, examples, and documentation aligned with the stable contract.

Match the size of the change to the evidence. Do not redesign unrelated code merely because a broader design looks cleaner.

## Prove the complete operation

Run the operation from input to externally visible result. Compilation proves only that the pieces fit.

- Exercise the ordinary workflow through the CLI, UI, API, or runtime surface that users rely on.
- Inspect the artifact or state at the boundary its consumers use.
- Try the misuse that the new boundary should prevent: skipped validation, stale context, partial commit, contradictory fields, or an escaped intermediate.
- Cover the relevant transitions and failure, recovery, concurrency, and resource behavior.
- If a contract claims exactness, inspect all relevant data with a trustworthy check rather than a sample or metadata proxy.
- After a removal or rename, confirm that code, tests, schemas, documentation, callers, and persisted references agree.

Add a lasting test only when a plausible regression would violate observable behavior or an invariant. Prefer guards in this order: representation, ownership or API, boundary validation, behavioral test, then a comment for a constraint that code cannot express.

Read the main flow once more. Check that each major step serves the stated job, each unit returns something usable, obsolete compensation is gone, and the next likely change has one obvious home. Continue only if this pass finds a material problem.

## Report and stop

Match the work to the request. In a review, report only material findings and say when suspicious code should stay. In a refactor, fix proven causes and make a clean cutover. When adding behavior, put it in the operation that already owns the job; reshape only when the current boundary cannot support it.

Report in this order:

```text
Purpose: the result this code must produce.
Problem: where the current structure makes that result unclear or unreliable.
Decision: what to merge, split, move, model, rename, or deliberately keep.
Check: the operation exercised and the result observed.
```

Treat metrics, line counts, abstraction counts, and uniformity as clues, not goals. Delete explanations whose cause is gone, but preserve comments that record a live, nonlocal constraint. Use specialist review for security, performance, accessibility, or domain claims that this skill cannot prove.

Stop when the job is clear, each important unit returns a valid result, supporting mechanics stay in the background, every fact has one owner, and behavior is proven. Another structural pass needs new evidence, not lingering aesthetic discomfort.
