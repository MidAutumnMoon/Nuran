# MidAutumnMoon's Neovim (ver. nix)

It turns out, home-manager/nixpkgs cannot handle complex plugin
management and configuration, which results solutions to became
problems at some points.

All configurations were moved to repository
[Numinus](https://github.com/MidAutumnMoon/Numinus), and the
remaining purpose of this module is to build a custom
Neovim wrapper which enables Treesitter and Coc to be used.
