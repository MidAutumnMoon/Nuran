    # Alias nixpkgs' browsers under the revisions playwright-cli expects.
    #
    # Why: Playwright resolves a browser by directory name `<name>-<rev>`
    # inside $PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH. The `<rev>` is pinned to the bundled
    # Playwright version, which can differ from nixpkgs' playwright-driver.
    # A mismatch = directory not found = silent fallback to internet download.
    #
    # Fix: read expected revs from the bundled browsers.json and symlink them
    # to whatever nixpkgs ships.
    #
    # Safety:
    #   - Browsers are driven over CDP, tolerant of minor version drift.
    #   - Diverging revisions are surfaced as a build-time warning.
    #   - Breaks if nixpkgs lags the bundled Playwright by a major version.
