Dear Santa san,

I am keeping being a good boy this half a year, and
I promise to be kind towards everyone forever. So as the
gift for the Christmas of this year, I hope I could
have a shiny and fun ACME client applications. Oh, and
it's also a smarter one than what I have on my hand!

Sincerely,
MidAutumnMoon
