    #
    # $cond will be passed to mkIf as-is

    #
    #
    # Usage:
    #
    #   condMod config.happy {

    #
    #
    # One gotcha is that
    # when mixing "options" or "imports" etc.
    # non-"config" fields in condMod body yields
    #
    #   condMod $cond {
    #       options.rocks = ...;
    #       programs.vlc.volume = 100;
    #   }
    #
    # which may cause confusion where "options"
    # seems to be guarded by "cond" while it's not.
    #
    condMod = cond: body:
        assert isAttrs body;
